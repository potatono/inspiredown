We're always looking forward to something: birthdays, vacations, major life events.  Count the days down to
something that inspires you by making a countdown timer.

Inspiredown is a super simple way to make a inspirational countdown timer.  It looks great in any sized
browser and is mobile friendly.  Just give us a link to a picture and a date in the future and we'll give you
a URL you can share.
